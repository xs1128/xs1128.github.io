Need to know how to find recursively, which is
find . 

then find files ignore directory's

find . -type f

then execut stat on It

stat -f "%m%t%Sm %N" --%m for modified date, %t for a random space, then %Sm for the datetime formate

then

stat -f "%m%t%Sm %N" 

then we can do exec

find . -type f -exec ... {} + -- where the {} + accepts as many pathnames as possible

then we combine both core parts

find . -type f -exec stat -f "%m%t%Sm %N" {} + 

we then pipe it with sorting, taking the top then cut of the unnecessary parts of the find stat

find . -type f -exec stat -f "%m%t%Sm %N" {} + | sort -rn | head -1 | cut -f2- 

the -rn flag for sort is due to rverse and numeric sort then the cut -f flag removes the field 2 compoenent
